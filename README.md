In this project i am building a simple financial Paycard application using Java SpringBoot framework.
As a Data Engineer, i am working with a broader scope of building fullstack data platforms/ apps that can serve data via extensible API's. Springbooot was a great choice . I could have acheived same with python's FastAPI/ Django/Flask. But the JVM seems to be a new found love being the base language of many Apache tools.


## Getting Started


## Controllers
